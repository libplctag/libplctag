 * types.
 *

 * the library.  You have been warned.   Close all tags first with plc_tag_destroy() and make
 * sure that nothing can call any library functions until this function returns.

 * plc_tag_register_callback
 *

 * being called:
 *
 *      * starting a tag read operation.
 *      * a tag read operation ending.
 *      * a tag read being aborted.
 *      * starting a tag write operation.
 *      * a tag write operation ending.
 *      * a tag write being aborted.
 *      * a tag being destroyed
 *
 * The callback is called outside of the internal tag mutex so it can call any tag functions safely.   However,
 * the callback is called in the context of the internal tag helper thread and not the client library thread(s).
 * This means that YOU are responsible for making sure that all client application data structures the callback
 * function touches are safe to access by the callback!
 *
 * Do not do any operations in the callback that block for any significant time.   This will cause library
 * performance to be poor or even to start failing!
 *
 * When the callback is called with the PLCTAG_EVENT_DESTROY_STARTED, do not call any tag functions.  It is
 * not guaranteed that they will work and they will possibly hang or fail.
 *
 * Return values:
 *
 * If there is already a callback registered, the function will return PLCTAG_ERR_DUPLICATE.   Only one callback
 * function may be registered at a time on each tag.
 *
 * If all is successful, the function will return PLCTAG_STATUS_OK.
