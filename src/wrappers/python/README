Python wrapper contributed by Matt McPheeters.  

This contains a Python wrapper and a reimplementation of the tag_rw example!  Thanks!!!

Here is what Matt said:

Please find my best effort of a working example for Python 2.7.10 or later,
on a machine that has libplctag.so (or plctag.dll) built and "on the path".

This should work, although the company that made their DH+ gateway
visible to us has since took it all down (so I can't verify after just basic
loading of the .so and checking of parameters).  I get the tag create error
though!

You can make this totally available on GitHub.  But it needs some level of
test and verification.  Should just have to install Python 2.7.10, ./run.sh, after
replacing the "TODO:attribute.." with a known good attribute string from your pure
C testing.
